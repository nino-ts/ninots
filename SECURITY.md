## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or declined, etc.

## Disclosure Policy

This project follows a coordinated disclosure model. We ask that you do not discuss any vulnerabilities in public until we have had a chance to address them.

## Security Update Process

When a security issue is reported, we will:

1. Confirm the vulnerability
2. Develop a fix
3. Release a security update
4. Notify users of the update
